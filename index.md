## I'm Glenn Rolland

I'm a CTO and co-founder of various organizations. I'm also a teacher and
learner.

I love algorithms, infrastructures, networks, security... But I also secretly
hate technology. I wonder about its evolution in the face of social,
environmental and political issues. Leverage for freedom or for oppression?

I'm an engineer but i'm also obsessed with the study of the rules that govern
humans systems interaction, that includes sociology, religion and anthropology,
in a quest to create resilient, contributive and a-centered society.

This blog is a central place for me to publish my musings on those topics and
more.
