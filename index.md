## I'm Glenn Rolland

I'm a CTO and co-founder of various organizations. I'm also a teacher and
learner.

I'm an engineer and I am obsessed by the study of the rules that govern the
interaction between the agents of a system for its good (or bad) functioning.
And when this system is not digital... it includes sociology, religion and
ethology and anthropology.

I love algorithms, infrastructures, networks, protocols, security... But I also
secretly hate technology. I wonder about its evolution in the face of social,
environmental and political issues. Leverage for freedom or for oppression?

I'm in a quest to create resilient, contributive and a-centered society where
we would value skills and relationships more than careers and money.

This blog is a central place for me to publish my musings on those topics and
more.
