Hi folks! In this issue, we continue to explore the topic of micro-services management, and we begin talking about mesh VPN, which is one of our current needs at [netcat\_](http://netcat.io).

<!-- more -->

As you can see below, I feel a growing need to organize better the articles and to group them by theme. Maybe we will end up with each issue covering a specific topic. But until a better tooling and process is found, I keep current structure. Still, I introduced two new categories: security & commons. I hope you'll like them.
